# [eyeTasks] - Simplify Your Tasks and Challenges

Welcome to eyeTasks, your all-in-one solution for seamless task management and conquering challenges. Enjoy a beautiful UI, effortless task handling, and unique features designed to enhance your productivity without the hassle of sign-ups.

## Features

### 1. No Sign-up Required (saving data locally)🚀

Your data, your rules! iTasks prioritizes your privacy by saving data locally, ensuring a secure and seamless experience without the need for sign-ups or sign-ins.

### 2. Beautiful UI with Easy Task Management 🎨

Enjoy a visually stunning user interface that makes task management a breeze. Easily add, edit, and delete tasks, ensuring a delightful user experience.

### 3. Challenge Yourself 🏆

Set challenges to elevate your productivity! Whether it's a 7-day project or another goal, iTasks helps you turn challenges into achievements.

### 4. Easy Management, No Pain 🤯

Experience task and challenge management without the headache. iTasks streamlines the process, making productivity enjoyable and stress-free.

### 5. Lightweight Jira-like Fields 🔧

Want Jira features without the complexity? iTasks now supports a few lightweight, Jira-like task fields while keeping the UI simple:

- Type: Story / Task / Bug / Improvement
- Assignee: Small, single-person field (name or initials)
- Due date: Choose a date (uses a native date input)
- Estimate / Story points: Simple integer value

These fields are optional and saved locally — they give you essential project-tracking power without the overhead of full Jira complexity.

### 6. Export: CSV & PDF 🗂️

You can now export your tasks (the currently filtered view) as CSV for spreadsheets or as a printable PDF (opens a printable view and uses the browser Print -> Save as PDF flow). The printable view opens in a new tab and automatically triggers the print dialog. If your browser blocks popups, the app will open the printable HTML as a fallback so you can still save or print manually.
